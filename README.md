# XLR8-TASBot
NES TASBot For Use on an Alorium XLR8 Board

I used an Alorium XLR8 Board with a 64MHz image loaded on it, as well as a SPI SD card breakout board to connect to and control an NES. I made my own run for Super Mario Bros. (the +Duck Hunt cart), but it could hypothetically work with any NES game.

The .ino sketch is to be loaded onto the XLR8 board, and the .bin is to be loaded onto an SD card and connected to the XLR8.

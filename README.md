# XLR8-TASBot
NES TASBot For Use on an Alorium XLR8 Board

I used an Alorium XLR8 Board with a 64MHz image loaded on it, as well as a SPI SD card breakout board to connect to and control an NES. I made my own run for Super Mario Bros. (the +Duck Hunt cart), but it could hypothetically work with any NES game.
